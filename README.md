# How can data science help French learners find songs that match their current languageÂ level?

With this work I wanted to make a complete analysis of a corpus of more than 4000 French songs and to classify them according to their vocabulary range. 
You can find the article where I explained how I worked on it on Medium by following this link: 

In the repository, you'll find as well the Python code I used to scrape the website Lyricstranslate and as well to get the list of vocabulary from Memrise. 

Thanks to those research, I created three playlists with the best songs for each level:
* A1: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4AzvFz5fEpRkK2XA4LeuYp?si=d08a12d4f6f84ac2&nd=1
* A2: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3SlzKQIfXU87bvADOn1MCz?si=aa83177e52ad4610&nd=1
* B2: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/76nJUFO3jFlL16rRQ97Ejv?si=071f3277f25544f4&nd=1
